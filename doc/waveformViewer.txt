Tracing/waveform viewing:

Waveform tracing can be very useful, even though we still don't have a good solution for 
TLM2 traces (VCD doesn't allow dynamically generated elements, which makes it useless for
TLM2). 

The mechanisms which ISCTLM provides for VCD traces can however be helpful and the tracing 
will be supported in the models. For tracing tools there are a number of options. 
I typically prefer simvision, but VCD is supported by other tools as well. In order to 
call simvision load the module incisive/14.20.00964bit and call simvision.

One weird thing is that the generated VCD files do not contain any hierarchy in the viewer.
This makes it very hard in a bigger design to keep track which signal is from where. I used 
a simple script to fix the VCD find so that the hierarchy is recognized. 

Another point to consider is that quantum settings imply that the waveform doesn't show any
values with a quantum. The sc_trace functions only trigger on SystemC kernel sync points.
In case one wants to see all the changes in the VCD file, the simulation has to be run
with a small quantum value (e.g. --Quantum 1).
