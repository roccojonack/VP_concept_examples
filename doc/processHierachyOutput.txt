It can be very useful to get an overview over which are the hierarchical elements in a 
given simulation. It is pretty easy to have the SystemC kernel to write out the hierarchy
and the elements in a SystemC simulation. But the port connections can be tricky to obtain.
I annotated the binding code to write out for this simulation the port bindings. The
connection of the annotated code and the SystemC output can be used to create several 
output formats. In order to get the relavent information from the simulation add the option
--scan. The output of the simulation <foo> can then be fed into the script:

createSystemCModule.pl -Input <foo>

There are different output formats available:

-outputType DOT (default)
-outputType TB
-outputType WRAPPER

The dot output can be further processed into an image or into SVG for visualization by 
webbrowser:
